# Execution

This directory contains deterministic Python scripts.
 These scripts:

- Handle API calls
- Process data
- Perform file operations
- Interact with databases

Execution scripts are the "Layer 3" of the 3-Layer Architecture defined in `AGENTS.md`.
They should be reliable, testable, and well-commented.
